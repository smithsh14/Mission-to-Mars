# Mission-to-Mars
Web Scraping with HTML/CSS

# Project Overview

As we continue to work with Robbin, the web app is coming along great but she would like to make it more polished.  To polish it up a bit more, Robbin would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. We have been tasked with using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images. 

This project has 3 specific deliverables.

- Deliverable 1: Scrape High-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
  - Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, you’ll scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images.
- Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
  - Using your Python and HTML skills, you’ll add the code you created in Deliverable 1 to your scraping.py file, update your Mongo database, and modify your index.html file so the webpage contains all the information you collected in this module as well as the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.
- Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components
  - For this part of the Challenge, update your web app to make it mobile-responsive, and add two additional Bootstrap 3 components to make it stand out.

## Results

The checkpoints for Deliverable 1 and Deliverable 2 can be found using the following images…
